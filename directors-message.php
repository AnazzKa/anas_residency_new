            <p>Dear Colleagues</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Al Jalila Children's Paediatric Residency Programme. On behalf of our entire faculty Iâ€™d like to thank you for your interest in joining this unique academic programme. It has been my privilege this past year to work on establishing and launching our first paediatric training programme, and I confidently invite you to join us as the first batch of post graduate trainees as we embark on this historic academic journey together.</p><br>
            <p>All through the preparation phase of this residency Programme, we were always guided and inspired by the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, when he launched this hospital. His Highness said: "All children should have an equal opportunity for success in life, and the treatment of children suffering from illness or disease should not be subject to geographical chance."</p><br>
            <p>Therefore, and as the first dedicated children's hospital in the UAE, our highly trained and specialized faculty will spare no efforts to ensure that our trainees get the required support to achieve excellence as general paediatrician, thus advocating for the wellbeing of all children and adolescents.</p><br>
            <p>Our unique position as a university affiliated academic medical institution is not only what sets us apart; for our familial culture and our belief that self-motivation and genuine dedication, is as important as medical excellence, are all pivotal factors that will put our trainees on the path of a fulfilling career decorated with many achievements.</p><br>
            <p>Our pledge for all of our trainees is that by the time you finish your residency programme at Al Jalila Children's, you will be well equipped with knowledge and determination to change the lives of many young patients and their families.</p>
            <p>We thank you for your interest and look forward to meeting you!</p>
