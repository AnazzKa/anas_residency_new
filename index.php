            <h2>Welcome to Al Jalila Children's  Paediatric Residency Programme</h2>
            <p>At Al Jalila Children's we have adapted the Saudi Board paediatric Curriculum for our Residency programme. This structured training programme has applied the CanMEDS Competency Framework as an innovative framework that describes the core knowledge, skills, and attitudes required of physicians. The curriculum is intended to provide a broad foundation for residents and faculty to focus on teaching and learning as well as clinical experience and professional development during the training programme period. All physicians participating in resident education will participate in a faculty development programme and workshop on the CanMeds Framework. Residents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills as well as develop an appropriate attitude and behavior throughout their training programme and take personal responsibility in learning.</p>
